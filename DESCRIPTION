Description: The package automates a proposed multivariate weighted
    indexing scheme for price data.  The multivariate weighted consumer
    price index (MVWCPI) generates weights for both base and current
    years, respectively, from base and current year price datasets using
    communality obtained after performing factor analysis. The package
    takes base and current year price data as inputs.  This approach is
    convenient since it does not require incurring additional cost for
    conducting household expenditure survey to generate CPI for the
    determination of inflation figures.  However, users can still generate
    the Laspeyresâ€™ CPI and inflation using base year expenditure data
    only.
