Description: automatically generates proposed multivariate weighted
    indexing scheme for price data.  mvWeightedCPI generates weights for
    both base and current years respectively, from base and current year
    price datasets. You provide the needed data and mvWeightedCPI works
    behind the scene to generate your weights. This approach is convenient
    since it does not require incurring additional cost for conducting
    household expenditure survey to generate CPI for the determination of
    inflation figures.
